# Bash Scripts I wrote

## add_local_user.sh
##### Written for Help Desk for easily adding users accounts on linux.
##### Usage: <code>$ ./add_local_user.sh Username Realname</code>

## docker-on-docker.sh
##### Originally written when I was experimenting in Jenkins (as a Docker image) and needed to build a docker image without using
##### an external node. I didn't know there was an official Docker in Docker image, and also there's no Jenkins on it...
