## 🕯 soldiers-data.py כריית מידע - חללי צה"ל במלחמת חרבות ברזל
<p>This is a python script I wrote with the help of AI for scraping info about our dear soldiers who died defending our country during the Iron Swords war. We used the output to create stickers for memory candles who were given out to school students after a memorial service.</p>
<p>I tried using Scrapy but since the website blocks bots, I had to use Chrome Driver from the Selenium package.</p>
<p>The script outputs a CSV with the name, date of death and unit of the soldier, from the IDF memorial website.</p>
